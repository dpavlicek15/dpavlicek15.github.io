### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    I enjoyed Lab 4 where we created a caluclator that caluclates the difference between two dates. 
    It was the first where I used a formula to calculate something. I also enjoyed formatting the code 
    so it looked cleaner. 

* Lab 7 part 2

    Creating the game blackjack was quite difficult but it was fun. It was the first time I wrote functions
    and it was really fun but diffiuclt. I liked how I was able to calulcate the hand value with many scenarios. 

* Lab 8 part 1

    Lab 8 part 1 was fun because i created a program that could tell if a word was a palindrome or not. It was able to
    read from a file and tell whether the word was a palindrome. I also learned how to read lines in a loop.
